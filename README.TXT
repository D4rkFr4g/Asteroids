USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Left and Right Arrow keys rotate the ship
Up Arrow Key accelerates ship forward
Down Arrow Key activates Hyperspace and moves you to a random location
Enter Key will restart the game if all lives are lost
Escape Key will return to title screen once all lives are lost


Known issues:	
?	Bullets travel at the speed your ship is moving. i.e. If your going full speed right and shoot straight down your bullets will go really fast as opposed to if you were standing still and shooting down.
?	Sounds for shooting bullets will sometimes skip and not play a sound for every bullet fired.
